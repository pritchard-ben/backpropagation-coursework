# backpropagation-coursework

This is a piece of coursework for my AI Methods module.
The task is to implement a backpropagation neural network training algorithm and explore improvements such as momentum and annealing.

cw.py contains my implementation, dataProcess.py contains my script which I used to process the data.

cw.py gets data from a text file and is customisable in terms of the number of inputs, nodes in the hidden layer and outputs.
